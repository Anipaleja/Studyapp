# Studyapp

These are the files for the Xcode ios version of the study app. 
ContentView.swift file is main file that holds together the other pages. 

In this app, im using some API keys that we can switch to become local later. I plan to try to NOT use as many APIs as possible, to limit the complications that can arise. 
I have an API in here for an AI assistant that I am currently incorporating into the app.
